      aka Adam Price </span>
      </br>
      </br>
      Freelance illustrator , photographer,  tattoo apprentice and multimedia
      visual art student at CMP Massey Wellington.
      Adam has been drawing since he could firmly grip a pencil and his style
      grows and changes as he does, though watery themes and gooey lines remain
      prevalent throughout the work. This style has now naturally transferred
      onto peoples skin with his recent aquisition of a tattoo machine and
      subsequent apprenticeship. His video work retains the themes of his other
      visual media, aquatic, flowing, vibrant and sparkly, and he has just begun
      working on the pilot episode for his directorial debut, The Willing Bodies.
