    <div class="about">
      Freelance illustrator , photographer,  tattoo apprentice and multimedia </br>
      visual art student at CMP Massey Wellington. </br>
      Adam has been drawing since he could firmly grip a pencil and his style </br>
      grows and changes as he does, though watery themes and gooey lines remain</br>
      prevalent throughout the work. This style has now naturally transferred </br>
      onto peoples skin with his recent aquisition of a tattoo machine and </br>
      subsequent apprenticeship. His video work retains the themes of his other </br>
      visual media, aquatic, flowing, vibrant and sparkly, and he has just begun </br>
      working on the pilot episode for his directorial debut, The Willing Bodies.
